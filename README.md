## CS441 Table List Widget

For this assignment I created an app that allows you to create your
own to-do list. Clicking the Create List button on the front page
would send you to the list creation where you can add and remove
tasks as you please. Clicking the add button prompts a popup window
to enter the task that needs completing and add task button will
add it to the list. To remove a task you can click on the ceck box
and then click remove to remove the selected item(s). The items in
the list are saved in internal storage so that when restarting the
app you can get back the list that you previously created. Additionally,
on the home page there is a hidden button that goes to the REAL to-do
list which contains an animated background that you can stare at and
procrastinate on your work.
